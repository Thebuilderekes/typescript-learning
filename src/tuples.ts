//A tuple is a way to group together multiple values of different types into a single variable. It's like a container that holds these values together. Tuples are ordered, meaning that the values inside have a specific order.

let user: [number, string] = [1, "ekeopre"];

//Best practice is to restrict you tuples to only two values
